## Timestamp

Big-endian 40 bit integer.
Represents the time passed since `January 1, 1970 12:00:00 AM UTC` in
hundredths of a second.

The timestamp will roll over on `June 4, 2318 6:57:57.760 AM UTC`.

## Differentiator

16 bits that are used to make the id unique within a given timestamp.
A random value or a counter could for example be used.

## Descriptor

8 bit value that information about the id. A database shard id for example.
